A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image with [Dradis](http://dradisframework.org/).

### Supported Tags and Respective `Dockerfile` Links

* `latest` ([*/Dockerfile*](https://github.com/TGRHavoc/dradis-docker/tree/master/Dockerfile))

#### What Is Dradis?

From [its own website](http://dradisframework.org/):

*The Dradis Framework is an open-source collaboration and reporting platform for IT security experts.*

*Dradis is a self-contained web application that provides a centralized repository of information to keep track of everything that has been done so far, and what is still ahead.*

#### How to Use This Image

##### Download the Image
```
    $ docker pull tgrhavoc/dradis-docker
```
##### Create a Directory to Store the Database Data
```
    $ mkdir -p dbdata/
```
##### Run Dradis

You need to set the `/dbdata` volume path:

```
    $ docker run \
        --publish 3000:3000 \
        --volume "$(pwd)/dbdata:/dbdata" \
      tgrhavoc/dradis
```

You can now open [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) to access Dradis.

#### Build from Sources

Instead of installing the image from Docker Hub, you can build the image from sources if you prefer:

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/TGRHavoc/dradis-docker dradis
    $ cd dradis
    $ docker build -t tgrhavoc/dradis .
```

#### Exposed TCP/IP Ports

* `3000`: Dradis application HTTP port.

#### Environment Variables Used at Runtime

* `SECRET_KEY_BASE`: Randomized string which is used to verify the integrity of signed cookies (randomly generated by default). See [here](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#config-secrets-yml).

You can change them using `docker run -e [...]` or in your *Dockerfile*, using the `ENV` instruction.

The docker working directory is set to the main Dradis directory (`/dradis`).
